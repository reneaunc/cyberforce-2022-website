                Being part of the Vita Vehiculum family means that we support the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EV). Utilizing our solar generation, Vita Vehiculum 
                has built a new electric vehicle manufacturing complex right here at Sonneberg Fields. It provides the capability of building EV in a plant run completely 
                off solar! It is much more efficient than any of our competitors! Please reach out via the Contact Us page for more information regarding our EV manufacturing.
